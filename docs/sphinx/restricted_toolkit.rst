RestrictedToolkit
=================

RPython (RestrictedPython) is a subset of Python that can be used in scripts
and templates edited through-the-web, without compromising system security.
Most modules can't be imported, so you need to find workarounds to do various
simple things. The rationale of RestrictedPython is to provide some helper
functions that are available anywhere. Please take care when adding functions
since you are crossing a security layer.

Example usage, from a Python Script in ZODB::

    >>> str_date = "Wed, 24 Mar 2010 14:42:00 +0100"
    >>> rstk = context.rstk # pulled from NySite by acquisition
    >>> print repr(rstk.parse_string_to_datetime(str_date))
    >>> return printed

This should output::

    datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 24, 14, 42, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, 3600))

The :class:`utils <Products.NaayaCore.managers.utils.utils>` class contains a
few more general-purpose utility functions. They are accessible in ``rstk`` via
acquisition, and will be migrated there eventually.
