2 Getting started
=================
- Login into your Naaya site and navigate to an existing Folder, or add one. 
  Add a new Media File. If all the required tools correctly installed, you'll
  be able to upload almost all known video formats
  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg for more details), if not, you'll 
  be able to upload only flash video files 
  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flv for more details).

- After the file was successfully uploaded, you can add subtitles in edit form 
  for every language that site supports. The subtitle format must be SubRip 
  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrip for more details). You can easily 
  create SubRip subtitles for your movies using Subtitle Workshop
  (see http://www.urusoft.net/products.php?cat=sw&lang=1 for more details).

- As playing video files on web requires video conversion on server side, the 
  video will not be available until the conversion is complete, therefore a 
  message will annotate this.
  
- If any error occurs in video conversion process, a generic message will 
  annotate this. For more details about errors occurred check the conversion
  log file located in the same directory as original video file.
